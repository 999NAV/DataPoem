## 1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation (Pandas and NumPy), data visualization (Matplotlib and Seaborn), and machine learning (scikit-learn and TensorFlow).

## 2. **Read Data**:
   - Load data from Excel files into Pandas DataFrames. One DataFrame (`df`) appears to contain checkpoint counts, and another DataFrame (`df2`) contains weather data.

## 3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the weather data (`df2`) by dropping unnecessary columns, extracting year, month, and week from the 'Date/Time' column, and calculating monthly and weekly means for temperature and other weather parameters.

## 4. **Visualize Temperature Trends**:
   - Create several line plots to visualize temperature trends. This includes yearly, monthly, and weekly temperature trends (maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures).

## 5. **Visualize Snow and Precipitation Trends**:
   - Similar to the previous step, create line plots to visualize snowfall and precipitation trends, both yearly and monthly.

## 6. **Data Scaling**:
   - Normalize the data using Min-Max scaling.

## 7. **Create Sequences and Labels for Machine Learning**:
   - Define a sequence length and features, create sequences, and corresponding labels. These sequences are used for machine learning input.

## 8. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

## 9. **FNN (Feedforward Neural Network) Model**:
   - Define and compile a feedforward neural network model with several dense layers.
   - Train the model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
   - Make predictions using the trained model.
   - Calculate and print the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the FNN model.
   - Visualize the actual vs. predicted values.

## 10. **Gradient Boosting Model**:
    - Create and train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model using scikit-learn.
    - Make predictions with the model.
    - Calculate and print the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the Gradient Boosting model.
    - Visualize the actual vs. predicted values.

## 11. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model**:
    - Define and compile an LSTM model for time series data.
    - Train the LSTM model using the training data.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
    - Make predictions using the trained LSTM model.

## 12. **Calculate Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:
    - Calculate the Mean Absolute Percentage Error for the LSTM model by comparing predicted values to actual values. The MAPE is a metric for evaluating the model's accuracy.

## 13. **Print and Display Results**:
    - Print the test loss for the LSTM model.
    - Print the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for the LSTM model.
    - Display the actual vs. predicted values for the Gradient Boosting model.

In summary, this code performs data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning using various models (FNN, Gradient Boosting, LSTM) to analyze and predict temperature and weather-related trends. The key metrics for model evaluation are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
